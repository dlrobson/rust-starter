# Dev Container

This is a development container for the project. To begin using it, there are two template files you must copy and modify:

1. `.env.template` -> `.env`
2. `compose.override.yaml.template` -> `compose.override.yaml`

The `.env` file contains environment variables that are used by the Docker Compose configuration. The `compose.override.yaml` file contains the Docker Compose configuration that is used to run the development container.

Then, you can develop using Dev Containers.
