# Dev Container

This is a development container for the project. To begin using it, there are two template files you must copy and modify:

1. `.env.template` -> `.env`
2. `docker-compose.override.yml.template` -> `docker-compose.override.yml`

The `.env` file contains environment variables that are used by the Docker Compose configuration. The `docker-compose.override.yml` file contains the Docker Compose configuration that is used to run the development container.

Then, you can develop using Dev Containers.
